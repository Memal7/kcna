## Chapter outcomes
After reading this page you should be able to:
- Describe and understand the concept of CI/CD.
- Describe and understand the concept of GitOps.
- Explain how the GitOps workflow looks and which benefits it has.
- Explain which GitOps frameworks are available and understand the concept of each of them.

## Describe the concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
- **CI:** describes the permanent building and testing of the written code.
- **CD:** automates the deployment of the pre-built software.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** are scripts containing all necessary steps to build and deploy an application, running on a server or in a container. Pipelines should be integrated with a version control system (e.g., Git) that manages changes to the code base. When a new version of your code is ready to be deployed, the pipeline executes scripts that build your code, run tests, deploy them to servers, and even perform security and compliance checks.
- There are two different approaches to how a CI/CD pipeline can implement the changes you want to make:
  - **Push-based:** the pipeline is started and runs tools that make the changes in the platform. Changes can be triggered by a commit or merge request.
  - **Pull-based:** an agent watches the Git repository for changes and compares the definition in the repository with the actual running state. If changes are detected, the agent applies the changes to the infrastructure.

## Describe the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- IaC is the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure resources through writing and executing code, rather than using manual configuration or GUIs.  
- IaC offers many benefits. To name some of them:
  - Provisioning the infrastructure resources in a automation, which is much faster and more consistent than manual.
  - Manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, stage, prod, etc.)
  - Repeatable usage of the IaC.
  - Versioning of IaC with version control (e.g., Git), so you can access and compare older versions or keep multiple versions in parallel.
  - IaC can be used as a documentation and anyone can access and understand it at any time.
  - ...and much more

## Describe the principles of GitOps and how it integrates with Kubernetes.
- GitOps takes the idea of Git as the single source of truth a step further and integrates infrastructure provisioning and change processes with version control operations.
- There are two examples of popular GitOps frameworks that use the pull-based approach: *ArgoCD* and *Flux*.
- ArgoCD is implemented as a k8s controller, while Flux is built with the GitOps Toolkit, a set of APIs and controllers that can be used to extend Flux or even create a custom delivery platform.
- K8s is particularly well suited for GitOps since it provides an API and is designed for declarative provisioning and changes of resources right from the beginning.
- K8s is using a similar idea as the pull-based approach: A database is watched for changes, and the changes are applied to the running state if it does not match the desired state.
